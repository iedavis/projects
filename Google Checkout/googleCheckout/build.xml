  <!-- Define the all task.  We do this here because we need to call tasks imported 
       in both the common.xml and deploy.xml files.  This may seem a bit odd but it
       feels better to segregate common tasks from j2ee deployment tasks and add 
       this extra bit of layering than have one massive common task file which has
       buttloads of targets, making it difficult to read.  You get my point separating
       the tasks in multiple imports makes this complex environment easier to get 
       around.  -->
